 into a directory and file name part.  If there is no file
 association, the value is an empty string.  As the following
 format codes are directly derived from this value, the same
 caveat applies to them as well.

%d: Directory name of the file associated with the buffer.
 Equals the full path without the file name.

%f: File name of the file associated with the buffer.  Decomposes
 into a file stem and a file extension.

%s: File stem of the file associated with the buffer.  Equals the
 file name without its extension.

 Equals the file name without its stem.  Includes the period if
